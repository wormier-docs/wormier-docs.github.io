	<h1>Building</h1>
	<p>It is now time to compile QMK into machine code for the keyboard! We will use this compiled firmware to flash to the keyboard in the next page.</p>

	<p>It is finally time to build, QMK makes it super simple, all you need to do is run this make command.</p>

	<pre class="code">
	  <code>make womier/k66:default</code>
	</pre>
	<p>When this is done it should make a directory called <b>.build</b> with a few files including a <b>.bin</b> file. This is what we are using to flash onto our keyboard. We will need to install the flasher for this, do you wish to use the pre-compiled binaries (recommended) or run it from source?</p>
